# Indian Income Tax – Official Provisions (Reference for FY 2024-25 / AY 2025-26)

## 1. Old vs New Tax Regime – Overview

- **Old Regime**: Allows various deductions (80C, 80D, 80CCD(1B), 80TTA, 24(b) home loan interest, HRA, Standard Deduction) before computing tax. Tax slabs: 0–2.5L nil, 2.5–5L 5%, 5–10L 20%, above 10L 30%.
- **New Regime**: Default for individuals from FY 2023-24. Very few deductions (mainly Standard Deduction for salaried). Lower concessional slabs: 0–3L nil, 3–6L 5%, 6–9L 10%, 9–12L 15%, 12–15L 20%, above 15L 30%.
- **Choice**: Salaried individuals can choose regime each year via Form 10IE/ITR; once chosen for a year, it applies for that year. Wrong choice can lead to higher tax liability.

## 2. Old Regime – Deductions and Limits

- **Section 80C**: Aggregate deduction up to ₹1,50,000 per year (PPF, ELSS, LIC, EPF, NSC, tuition fees, principal repayment of home loan, etc.). Not available in New Regime.
- **Section 80CCD(1B) – NPS**: Additional deduction up to ₹50,000 for self-contribution to NPS. Over and above 80C. Not available in New Regime.
- **Section 80D – Health Insurance**: Self/family up to ₹25,000; senior citizens (self) up to ₹50,000; parents (non-senior) ₹25,000; parents (senior) ₹50,000. Not available in New Regime.
- **Section 80TTA**: Interest on savings account up to ₹10,000 (individual/HUF). Not available in New Regime.
- **Section 24(b) – Home Loan Interest**: Deduction on interest on home loan for self-occupied property up to ₹2,00,000 per year. Not available in New Regime.
- **Standard Deduction**: ₹50,000 for salaried individuals (both regimes).
- **HRA Exemption**: Only in Old Regime. Based on salary, HRA received, rent paid, and 50% (metro) or 40% (non-metro) of salary. No HRA in New Regime.

## 3. New Regime – Key Points

- Rebate u/s 87A: If total income after deductions (Standard Deduction) is up to ₹7,00,000, tax is nil (effective zero tax up to 7L).
- Old Regime rebate 87A: Tax nil if taxable income up to ₹5,00,000.
- No 80C, 80D, 80CCD(1B), 80TTA, 24(b), or HRA in New Regime. Employer NPS 80CCD(2) is still allowed in New Regime.

## 4. Eligibility and Compliance Risks

- **Regime switch**: Choosing New Regime and then claiming 80C/80D etc. is invalid; such deductions are not allowed in New Regime.
- **Professional Tax**: State-specific; allowed as deduction from salary in both regimes (subject to state rules).
- **Common mistake**: Assuming 80C/80D deductions in New Regime leads to under-reporting of income and compliance risk.
- **Another mistake**: Comparing only tax slabs without considering actual deductions; if deductions are high, Old Regime may be better.
- **Senior citizens**: Different 80D limits and rebate conditions; age 60+ for senior, 80+ for super senior.

## 5. Surcharge and Cess

- Health and Education Cess: 4% on income tax (both regimes).
- Surcharge: Applicable at higher income levels (e.g. 10% above 50L, 15% above 1Cr, etc.) for both regimes.
